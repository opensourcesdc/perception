# Open Source Self Driving Car - Perception

## What

A collection of tools related to perception tasks in building self driving cars, specially on steering models by computer vision techniques. 

Proposed strucuture includes,
- `tools`: data io tools/scripts that interface with popular SDC simulation platform, e.g, [udacity/self-driving-car-sim](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim), OpenAI Universe and ROS system.
- `models`: model zoo for SDC steering based on camera images
- `resources`: online materials, courses, tutorials, commnunity presentations/talks.
- `existing models`: we are not going to reinvent the wheel, what we want to do is push the frontiers, so we will be building upon the best open-sourced models other there we can find, which would be posted here

## Current Milestone
1. build several working models to be tested on the simulator and on real-life collected video data
2. visualize the learned models and present to the community.


Feel free to contribute.
